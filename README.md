# Car_Racing_game

The "Car Racing Game" is a 2D racing simulation developed using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It simulates a simple car racing environment where multiple AI controlled cars navigate a race track defined by a set of checkpoints, while the player controls one car using keyboard inputs. The game emphasizes movement physics, path following AI, and basic collision detection, providing an interactive simulation of autonomous and playerdriven cars in a racing context
